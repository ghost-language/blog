Hello there, and welcome to the blog! ðŸ‘‹

Ghost is all about dispelling and opening black boxes; How do languages work? What process do they go through to translate the commands I type in an editor down to the ones and zeros that our machines consume? I hope to answer these questions and more through this blog as I research and learn.

The blog will also be used to announce development updates and releases as the language and ecosystem matures.

I'm also hoping that by taking some of the downtime inbetween coding and learning to reflect on everything and write out will not also be therapeutic, but also deepen my understanding of the topics.

> You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing â€” that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.
