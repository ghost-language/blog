## Introduction
This post was inspired by an article written over at [PHP Internals](https://phpinternals.net/articles/implementing_a_range_operator_into_php) detailing a similar topic by implementing a range operator into PHP.

Here, we'll demonstrate how to implement a new operator into Ghost. Doing so will allow us to cover the following topics:

- **Updating our available tokens:** When introducing a new element to our language, we need to create a token that we will later parse and extract information from to make evaluation easier.
- **Updating the lexer:** We'll take a look at how the lexer works and how we'll traverse the raw source code fed to the interpreter to convert our range operator into its associated token.
- **Updating the parser:** Our parser determines where and how the range operator can be used, as well as what _precedence_ it has in comparison to our other operators.
- **Updating the evaluator:** Our evaluator is the final step in our journey as we'll now handle _what_ the range operator actually performs during execution of our program.
- **Writing tests:** As Ghost is a programming language, it is the bedrock on which developers will use to develop programs of their own. As such, our implementation must be as bullet proof as possible, and we should avoid breaking features in future updates. Having a robust test suit covering every details of our language will keep everything in check.

The above items cover a large portion of the internal working of Ghost's implementation in Go and its tree-walking interpreter. There are some aspects we will not be covering as we will not need to work with them, such as the object and abstract syntax tree systems. We may cover these in a separate but similar blog post in the future.

## The Range Operator
The operator that will be added into Ghost in this post will be called the range operator (`..`). To keep things simple, the range operator will be defined with the following semantics:

1. The incrementation step will always be `1`
2. Both operands must be `numbers`

If any of the above semantics are not satisfied, then an `Error` will be thrown.

### Examples
```dart
1 .. 3            // >> [1, 2, 3]
2.5 .. 5          // >> [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]
1 .. number('3')  // >> [1, 2, 3]

a := b := 1
a .. b            // >> [1]

2 .. 1            // Error
1 .. '1'          // Error
foo() .. 1        // Error
```

## Updating Tokens
The first step, and argubly the simplest one, will be registering our new token. When we perform a lexical analysis or scan of our raw Ghost source code, we will have a token that signifies our range operator.

All tokens can be found within `tokens/token.go`. This is largely a very simple file. What we're interested in is the `const` table of tokens:

```go
...
// The list of tokens.
const (
	// Special tokens
	ILLEGAL = "ILLEGAL"
    EOF     = "EOF"
    ...
```

We're simply going to add a new value here - it doesn't matter where it goes but we'll try to keep things organized, so we'll place it under the `MINUSMINUS` token. We're going to call our new token `RANGE` and simply assign what its token representation will be.

```go
...
MINUSMINUS = "--"

RANGE = ".."
...
```

Perfect! We have our new token. That wasn't so bad. Let's move on to the lexer.
